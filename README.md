This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Ruby related to accessing instance variables within the `method_missing` method.  The `method_missing` method is designed to handle calls to undefined methods, but directly accessing instance variables from within this method unexpectedly raises a `NoMethodError`.  The solution provides a workaround to correctly access instance variables in this scenario.
